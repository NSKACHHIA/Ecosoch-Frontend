            A carefully constructed and complete design is the foundation for a
            successful PV system. A well-established plan helps to ensure that
            our installation team would be able to proceed efficiently with
            system construction. Hence, the details of your system must be
            carefully established and clearly outlined for a smooth installation
            process.

            Our design services are not limited to only the electrical
            components. We also have structural engineers and fabricators to
            design the physical infrastructure that literally supports the
            system. This integrated approach to the design process allows us to
            provide you with a comprehensive set of plans and specifications,
            the quality of which is one of the best in the industry.

            We deliver complete construction-ready plan-sets within budget and
            on-time – no exceptions. Our interest is in delivering the best
            system to you, our client, with your highest interests considered at
            every step of the design process. We believe quality during the
            design process is the first step in assuring you will not be
            performing costly retrofits or replacement of equipment either
            before or after your system is completed. Your investment on our
            Design & Engineering services will be recouped many-fold through
            fewer problems during construction and for the life of the system.

            are looked at by another PV expert that is not part of the design
            team for construct-ability, safety, code compliance, and overall
            presentation. The depth and level of expertise reviewing each set of
            plans we produce are second-to-none in the industry. You can rest

            Engineering also offers third-party reviews of engineered designs by
            EPC’s and other design firms using the same staff that performs our
            internal engineering quality reviews.

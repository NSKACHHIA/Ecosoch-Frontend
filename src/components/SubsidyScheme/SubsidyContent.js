            customers (Individual homeowners) can install solar rooftop system
            on their premises and avail the subsidy (or Central Financial
            Assistance – CFA) directly from the Central Government. To
            facilitate this scheme, Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE)

              The subsidy would be calculated on the basis of total solar module
              capacity/solar inverter capacity/capacity approved by DISCOM,
              whichever is lower. For example, if solar module capacity is
              2.4kWp and solar inverter capacity is 3kW, the subsidy would be
              calculated on 2.4kW since it is the lowest. So, subsidy would be
              (2 x 30,000) +(0.4 x 18,000) = Rs 67,200.
